## Project Overview

Flight delays impact travelers, airlines, and airport operations. This dashboard analyzes:

- When and where delays happen most  
- Which airlines and airports perform poorly  
- What causes delays (weather, air traffic, equipment, etc.)  
- How seasonality affects flight operations

## Key Insights

Flight delays in the United States remain a persistent and multifaceted challenge, impacting millions of passengers annually and incurring substantial economic costs. 
This analysis, grounded in real-world data from 2023 and supported by academic and industry research, uncovered critical insights into the operational inefficiencies, environmental influences, and systemic vulnerabilities within the air travel ecosystem.

By using Tableau dashboards to visualize over 6 million flight records across routes, airlines, and weather conditions, we revealed that:
1.	Delays are not evenly distributed: Smaller regional airports such as Santa Maria (SMX) and Pago Pago (PPG) exhibited disproportionately high average delays, likely due to limited infrastructure, less operational buffer, and weather unpredictability.
2.	Weather is a major but nuanced factor: While adverse weather, especially precipitation and high winds correlates with delays, its direct impact is often moderated by proactive cancellations or diversions. 
3.	Aircraft age and manufacturer type influence delays: Older aircraft showed a greater likelihood of delays, supporting the argument for fleet renewal strategies.
4.	Airlines demonstrate variable resilience: Some, such as Alaska and Delta, performed better under poor weather conditions, while others like Allegiant, Spirit and JetBlue were more susceptible to operational breakdowns.
5.	Routes matter: High-traffic corridors like SFO-LAX experience high-frequency delays due to air traffic congestion and minimal recovery time between flights.

This dashboards offers stakeholders a scalable decision-support system, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence for airlines, airport operators, and even passengers.
